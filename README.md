# Thanks for checking out this TI4 Event and Trade overhaul!

## How to edit:
Here are a series of files which are opened in CardMaker, which you can find at https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker.

In order not to leak personal information, the relative paths have been broken inside the main .cmp file.  To fix this, if you open project.cmp file inside CardMaker, then right-click on each layout, you can select "Add Excel Reference" and then select the appropriate sheet inside the "card_lists.xlsx" Excel file (named the same as the layouts).

## Editing:
Inside the Inputs folder, you can also find the source .xcf files for the card back PNG files, in case you want to change them.

## Premade outputs:
Inside the Output folder, you can find the final .png files created from an Image-based export from CardMaker.  These are designed to be printed at 600 DPI into standard Mini-American cards, the same size as the ones from the base game.

## Basic info:
These cards are supposed to be approximately 43mm x 65mm (1.614 inches x 2.559 inches).
They are made at 600 DPI, plus assuming 72 pixel edges on each side for card cutting, this makes 1144 pixel by 1644 pixel cards which will have their edges cut off.
