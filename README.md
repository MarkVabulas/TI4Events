# Fan-made Unofficial TI4 Event and Trade overhaul

The purpose of this expansion is to make *Commodities* and *Trade Goods* a lot more interesting, with deeper mechanics that will change how people want to trade and transact over time.  This is supplemented with the new *Event Phase*, which sits comfortably between picking Strategy Cards and people playing their actions.  These new events are designed to be a source of random change thrown into the mix, because even the best laid plans can be thrown off by your neighbor getting that 1 extra Trade Good Card no one expects!  (Little do you know, the new Trade Good Card is only good for Influence!!!)  The Event Cards can be brutal, but there is still strategy to it. The new *Vice-Speaker* role (whenever a new Speaker is nominated, the previous Speaker becomes Vice-Speaker) is in charge of much of the Event Phase, showing their still lingering power and making it a gamble... do you REALLY want to take the Speaker role (for those juicy Strategy Cards) or do you want to avoid handing them control of the upcoming events?!  Furthermore, the new Event Cards spice up the *Agenda* phase, by allowing everyone to see the upcoming Agenda Cards before the draw, with a different number of Agenda Cards based on the specific Event that happened.

This fan-made unofficial expansion consists of 152 new Commodity Cards, 180 new Trade Good Cards, 160 new All-Unique Event Cards, and 4 Instruction Cards.

## Manual/Instructions for play

### Event Cards
- Between each Strategy Phase and Action Phase, including at the start of the game, there is a new Event Phase.  In the Event Phase, the Speaker reveals the top Event Card of the Event Deck and plays it.  Each Event Card has two parts, an Event and an Agenda Reveal; both are played.
- During the first Event Phase of the game, only the Agenda Reveal of the Event Card is played.
- If an order of play is not specified on a card, then it starts with the Vice-Speaker, moving anti-clockwise.
- Event Cards can be: immediate, stay in play until the next Event Phase, or permanent (as stated on the card). 
- It is possible, through game effects, to play multiple Event Cards per Event Phase.
- Transacting is encouraged in this phase.

### Agenda Phase
- There is a new role, the Vice-Speaker.  Whenever any player becomes the Speaker, the old Speaker becomes the Vice-Speaker. At the start of the game, the Vice-Speaker is the player to the right of the Speaker.
- During the Agenda Phase, the Vice-Speaker selects the order of play of the revealed Agenda Cards, without drawing more.
- If an effect specifies manipulating the top of the Agenda Deck, the revealed Agenda Cards are included.  This means any effect which rearranges the Agenda Card Deck can mix or replace the hidden Agendas with the revealed Agenda Cards, as long as the final count of revealed Agenda Cards is the same.

### Trade Goods
- Each time a player should gain any number of Trade Goods, they instead draw that many Trade Good Cards.  Any effect referring to a Trade Good is now referring to a Trade Good Card.
- Most of the Trade Good Cards can be used as before, at any time.
- Some Trade Good Cards are used only during PRODUCTION, and have their associated effect listed on the card.
- Some Trade Good Cards can be played as actions, and therefore function similarly to Action Cards.
- As before, all Trade Good Cards can be Transacted.
- Some of the Trade Good Cards allow using them as Influence, including during the Agenda Phase.

### Commodities
- Each time a player should gain any number of Commodities, they instead draw that many Commodity Cards. Any effect referring to a Commodity is now referring to a Commodity Card.
- Commodity replenishment rules are unchanged.
- Commodity Card effects are kept secret except when resolving a Transaction.
- While Transacting with an opponent, each player pledges the Commodities they will Transact. Upon agreement, each player then reveals what each of their pledged Commodities does and performs the stated action.
- Some Commodities are played as Actions now, instead of only Transacting. They may be pledged in a Transaction, but are therefore given to the opponent instead of played during the Transaction.

## How to edit
Here are a series of files which are opened in CardMaker, which you can find at https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker.

In order not to leak personal information, the relative paths have been broken inside the main .cmp file.  To fix this, if you open project.cmp file inside CardMaker, then right-click on each layout, you can select "Add Excel Reference" and then select the appropriate sheet inside the "card_lists.xlsx" Excel file (named the same as the layouts).

## Editing
Inside the Inputs folder, you can also find the source .xcf files for the card back PNG files, in case you want to change them.

## Premade outputs
Inside the Output folder, you can find the final .png files created from an Image-based export from CardMaker.  These are designed to be printed at 600 DPI into standard Mini-American cards, the same size as the ones from the base game.

## Basic info
These cards are supposed to be approximately 43mm x 65mm (1.614 inches x 2.559 inches).
They are made at 600 DPI, plus assuming 72 pixel edges on each side for card cutting, this makes 1144 pixel by 1644 pixel cards which will have their edges cut off.
